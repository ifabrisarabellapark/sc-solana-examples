# Solana Program | PDA :octopus: :telephone:

A program Derived Address (PDA) in Solana is an account with only a public key (no private key) and owned by a program - just like any other Solana account. Why do we care? PDAs are the foundation of Cross-Program Invocation and what allows for the composability of dapps in the Solana blockchain. Through PDAs, programs can programmatically sign for certain addresses without needing a private key. I sometimes think of PDAs as escrow accounts or high-level managers of lower-level accounts.
